5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## Usage

Once the Streamlit application is running, you can interact with it through the web interface. Enter the required input data and click on the enter button to trigger the AI model's response. The output generated by the model will be displayed on the screen.
